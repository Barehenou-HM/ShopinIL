Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 6, 2026

Introduction This Privacy Policy applies to the ShopinIL mobile application. This application is a blank, non-functional software designed for testing or placeholders. It does not perform any commercial activity, nor does it facilitate shopping or any other services.

Information Collection and Use ShopinIL does not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Information. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, physical address, phone number, location data, or device identifiers. Because the application consists of a blank screen, there are no features that require the input or collection of data.

Third-Party Access We do not share any information with third parties. This application does not use third-party services such as advertising networks, analytics providers, or social media plugins that could track your activity or collect your data.

Cookies and Tracking ShopinIL does not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies.

Children’s Privacy Since this application does not collect any data, it does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

Security Although the application does not handle data, we value your trust. Since no information is collected, there is no risk of your personal data being compromised through the use of this app.

Changes to This Privacy Policy I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately upon being posted.
